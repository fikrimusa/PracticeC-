Adapter Design Pattern
1. Allows two incompatible interfaces to work together.
2. Works by converting one interface to another.

When to use the adapter?
1. To integrate legacy code into your projects.
2. When modifying the legacy component's source code is not possible.

- Adapter solves the problem of integrating incompatible interfaces into existing designs.

Pitfalls
- New intermediary class
- Increased complexity
- Unexpected behaviour
- Performance considerations
